          "description": "# TFIP-1: Claim Proxy Ownership of Lending Pools\n**Abstract**\n\nThis proposal intends for the TrueFi DAO to claim ownership of tfLP liquidity pools in the TrueFi protocol. The goal of this proposal is to extend the decentralization of the protocol.\n\nBy claiming proxy ownership, the DAO will fully control upgrades for these smart contracts. Therefore, the only way to modify the code or logic for these contracts would be through a governance vote on-chain.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe TrueFi protocol includes 4 permissionless pools: tfTUSD, tfUSDC, tfUSDT, tfBUSD. The liquidity in these pools has been controlled by stkTRU votes, but the actual ownership of the smart contracts has been managed by a multisig. In order for these pools to be truly decentralized, control of upgrades to these contracts must be controlled by the TrueFi DAO. Claiming ownership of these contracts allows the DAO to fully own and operate its own liquidity pools.\n\n**Summary**\n\nTrueFi uses a smart contract proxy pattern - each contract consists of a proxy (public facing address) and an implementation (actual code). Code from the implementation is loaded into the proxy contract every time someone wants to interact with the smart contract. The proxy owner has the ability to change the implementation contract in order to add new functionality or logic.\n\nIn order to control the smart contract proxies, a function call needs to be made to each liquidity pool proxy address. Before the claimProxyOwnership() function can be called, the previous owner multisig will call the transferProxyOwenrship() function."

Executing these transactions will allow the DAO to own these tokens and perform future upgrades for the stkTRU smart contract.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nCurrently the stkTRU and TRU smart contract proxies are owned by a multisig. In order for TrueFi to become truly owned by its users, the DAO needs to own the proxy for these contracts, thus giving governance the capability to upgrade these contracts.\n\n**Summary**\n\nTrueFi uses a smart contract proxy pattern - each contract consists of a proxy (public facing address) and an implementation (actual code). Code from the implementation is loaded into the proxy contract every time someone wants to interact with the smart contract. The proxy owner has the ability to change the implementation contract in order to add new functionality or logic.\n\nIn order to control the smart contract proxies, a function call needs to be made to each liquidity pool proxy address:\n\n**Token Proxies**\n\nTRU: 0x4C19596f5aAfF459fA38B0f7eD92F11AE6543784\nstkTRU: 0x23696914Ca9737466D8553a2d619948f548Ee424\n\nBefore the claimProxyOwnership() function can be called, the previous owner multisig will call the transferProxyOwenrship() function.\n\nIn addition to the proxy ownership for the TRU contract, there is an owner role. The owner is still allowed to mint TRU up to the maximum supply of 1.45 billion. By claiming the owner role in the TRU smart contract, governance will control the ability to mint the remaining 8,870,574 TRU that was previously burned.\n\n**Actions**\n\n1.

          "description": "# [TFIP-6] Assign CANCELLER role\nAbstract\n\nTo protect the DAO from potential governance attacks, we propose assigning the CANCELLER role to the multisig 0x8c8FcA3812c4272756120E207D3ED496A73Bc528.\n\nFollowing security measures have been undertaken:\n\n - All signers are using hardware wallets\n - Members are geographically dispersed\n - There is a stringent procedure in place for reviewing all proposals, which includes performing reviews and simulations before execution.\n\nMultisig Settings\n\n - Multisig threshold is 3/6.\n\nSigners\n - 2 persons coming from Archblock ecosystem\n - 2 persons connected to Wallfacer\n - 2 long-time community members\n\n\nBackground\n\nAfter the recent Tornado Cash governance attack 2 it seems increasingly important to protect the DAO from a similar scenario. To safeguard TrueFi DAO we propose setting the CANCELLER address in our Governor to 0x8c8FcA3812c4272756120E207D3ED496A73Bc528. The CANCELLER role is already implemented in our Governance as a result of TrueFi using OpenZeppeling’s governance contracts, but it has not previously been set.\n\nWhat CANCELLER can do:\n\n - In case there is a proposal that is faulty or adversarial - canceller can execute a transaction that would render the proposal ineffective.\n\nWhat CANCELLER can’t do:\n\n - Canceller can NOT make any decisions or execute any transactions on behalf of the DAO. Its only power is to CANCEL proposals.\n\nThere is precedent for something like this at major protocols like Curve that have their Emergency DAO (https://dao.curve.fi/emergencymembers) in the case of malicious behavior.\n\nRisks:\n\nIt is worth noting that there are certain scenarios where CANCELLER could actually collude with a black hat hacker to extract value from protocols by delaying “rescue proposals”. As a result, CANCELLER should be treated as a temporary measure until there is more value in the protocol and/or a better solution is found.\n"

The borrowed capital will serve as a financial bridge to manage this gap. By leveraging these funds, Kryptonim guarantees uninterrupted operations for users and sets the stage for consistent business expansion.\n\nKryptonim, in its strategic efforts to sustain growth and smooth operations, is actively seeking to secure a loan of 10 million USD. Lenders collaborating in this initiative will receive yield based on the curve defined by the Line of Credit parameters. Yield for lenders comes from users paying fees to use Kryptonim.\n\nRead more: [Kryptonim's forum post](https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-kryptonim-intent-to-deploy-liquidity-line-of-credit/1516)\n"
